### Hi, I'm Henriette!

I am a Norwegian living in Denmark where I have studied Computer Science. I graduated in 2019 and I am now aSoftware Engineer with previous work in the financial sector with a large Danish bank and in IBM Client Innovation Center. Currently I am employed as a Developer Consultant at Netlight Consulting. In my spare time I like to cook and for the same reason I have created my own online cookbook (using Vue hosted on Heroku)
