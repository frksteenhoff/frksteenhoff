### Hi, I'm Henriette! :wave:

I am a Norwegian living in Denmark where I have studied Computer Science. I graduated in 2019 and I am now a Software Engineer. I have previous experience from the financial sector with a large Danish bank and in IBM Client Innovation Center. Currently I am employed as a Developer Consultant at Netlight Consulting. My current role is a s a frontend developer but I am ready to take on almost anything -- I love to learn. In my spare time I like to travel, learn and cook (and eat!) and for the same reason I have created my own online cookbook (using Vue hosted on Heroku)
