### Hi, I'm Henriette! :wave:

I am a Norwegian Computer Scientist who studied in Denmark and now live in Zürich, Switzerland 🏔️ 🇨🇭 I graduated in 2019 as a Software Engineer from the Technical University of Denmark. I have previous experience from the financial sector with a large Danish bank and in IBM Client Innovation Center. Currently I am employed as a Developer Consultant at Netlight Consulting. My last role was as a frontend developer but I am ready to take on almost anything -- I love to learn and believe that as long as you know the programming basics of your domain, you can transition between languages easily. 

I am a social developer I love to discuss solutions and find good compromises. For me, a good software solution is one developed as a collaboration, not a one-person-job. In my spare time I like to dive, travel, drink beer, do escape rooms and cook -- for the same reason I have created my own online cookbook (using Vue hosted on Heroku) to keep track of my recipes and have access to them anywhere.

I am also a part of the camp "Camp Hest" (Camp Horse) @ Roskilde Festival and run a webpage for our camp here:

Most of the projects I have worked on personally, professionally and related to my studies are shown here (unless they for some reason have to be private). I love to share my work and make this available from whereever and for whomever. Feel free to check them out, fork them or contribute.

I tweet a lot about climate, education, being a woman in STEM, social justice etc. if you find this interesting, find me on Twitter!
