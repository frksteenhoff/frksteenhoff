### Hi, I'm Henriette! :wave:

I am a Norwegian living in Denmark where I have studied Computer Science. I graduated in 2019 and I am now a Software Engineer. I have previous experience from the financial sector with a large Danish bank and in IBM Client Innovation Center. Currently I am employed as a Developer Consultant at Netlight Consulting. My current role is a s a frontend developer but I am ready to take on almost anything -- I love to learn. In my spare time I like to travel, learn and cook (and eat!) and for the same reason I have created my own online cookbook (using Vue hosted on Heroku)

I am also a part of the camp "Camp Hest" (Camp Horse) @ Roskilde Festival and run a webpage for our camp here:

Most of the projects I have worked on presonally, professionally and related to my studies are shown here (unless they for some reason have to be private). I love to share my work and make this available from whereever and for whomever. Feel free to check them out, fork them or contribute.

I tweet a lot about climate, education, being a woman in STEM, social justice etc. if you find this interesting, find me on Twitter!
